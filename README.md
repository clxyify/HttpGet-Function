# HttpGet-Method

An alternative method for using ``HttpGet()``.

Lots of people use `loadstring(game:HttpGet(('link'),true))()` but we are better then this.

I've developed another method that does the same function in C# and it's pretty easy!


You can test to see if the function works, by running this sample:
```csharp
//StartWeb(); -> may or may not speed up downloading process
string my_script_link = "";//raw paste data goes here
HttpGet(my_script_link);//run httpget script
```
